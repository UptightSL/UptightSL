# What's the problem?

It's been almost 6 years since I first started to learn Lua and programming in general, of course most of the time was spent lollygaggin rather than actually programming/learning to, or else I would be a decent developer!  
What's the problem you may ask? I do not know. I've spent so much time trying to learn the past year or two at full speed but haven't gotten that far. I still have problems with common issues that most developers would fix or get around quite easily.  
Maybe I just have a difficulty learning or programming isn't for me. If that's the case then it really sucks since I am extremely interested in getting better at programming and feel quite gravitated towards it.  
Anyways basically if anyone would like to help out please feel free to message me, I cannot seem to unlock the code in my brain to learn to code. If you have any tips please share them with me if you are willing to.

**THANK YOU**

P.S: To my two great friends that have helped me with a few things here and there I give you a personal thank you. You do not understand how much it means to me, especially for you to waste your time with me.
